Conversion from one data type to another.
========================================
1)int
2)double
3)long
4)float
5)boolean
6)String

Java Operators
==============
There are about 4 categories of Java Operators
1) Arithmetic Operators {+, -, *, /, %, ++, --}
2) Relational Operators {==, !=, >, <, >=, <=}
3) Logical Operators {&&, ||, !}
4) The assignment Operators {=, +=, -=} a = 2; a += b => a = a+b; a -= b => a = a-b;
5) String Operators {+ => Tunde + Faneye = TundeFaneye}

Control Flow Statements
There are 3 broad categories
1) Decision-Making Statements {if, if-else, switch}
   ==> An if-else statement can test expressions based on ranges of values or boolean conditions
   while a switch statement tests expressions based on a single integer, enumerated value or
   String object
2) Looping Statements {while, do-while, for}
    for loop syntax:
            for(initialisation; termination; increment){
                //statement
            {
3) Branching Statements {break, continue, return}

Assignment:
1) Print out the number of i in mississipi
2) Write an if-else statement to print the months in a year

Constructors:
Usage:
1)Constructor initialises instance variables at the run time
2)if don't create constructor, compile will create a default one at the run time
3)Each time you create an object, you are invoking a constructor

Rule:
1) Constructor must bear the same name as the class
2) Constructor must not have a return type
3) Constructor cannot be abstract, static, or final

There are basically two types of constructors:
1)Default i.e this when you do not declare a constructor
2)Parameterized constructors
============================================

Taking Input
------------
1) BufferedReader class
2) Scanner class

Class work
Build an app called Commission App
This app should be able to calculate commission based on the sales.
This commission will be based on % of different sale range

Requirements
=> Any sales between £1 and £99 inclusive should be given commission of 2.5%
=> Any sales between £100 and £500 inclusive should be given commission of 8%
=> Any sales between £501 and £1000 inclusive should be given commission of 12.5%
=> Any sales between £1001 and £5000 inclusive should be given commission of 17.5%
=> Any sales above £5000 should be given commission of 23%
=> The system should be able to inform the Sales Rep what commission they have earned and the net amount
    that should go into company's account.

Creating and Reading data from File
===================================
Java Classes that will help us create and read from files
1) File class
2) FileWriter class

Reading data from files
1)FileReader class => allows us to read plain text from txt file (notepad)
2)FileInputStream class
